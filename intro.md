## 1. Reactive execution

A marimo notebook is made up of small blocks of Python code called
cells.

marimo reads your cells and models the dependencies among them: whenever
a cell that defines a global variable  is run, marimo
**automatically runs** all cells that reference that variable.

Reactivity keeps your program state and outputs in sync with your code,
making for a dynamic programming environment that prevents bugs before they
happen.


```

        f"""
        **‚ú® Nice!** The value of `changed` is now {changed}.

        When you updated the value of the variable `changed`, marimo
        **reacted** by running this cell automatically, because this cell
        references the global variable `changed`.

        Reactivity ensures that your notebook state is always
        consistent, which is crucial for doing good science; it's also what
        enables marimo notebooks to double as tools and  apps.

## 2. UI elements

Cells can output interactive UI elements. Interacting with a UI
element **automatically triggers notebook execution**: when
you interact with a UI element, its value is sent back to Python, and
every cell that references that element is re-run.

marimo provides a library of UI elements to choose from under
`marimo.ui`.

**üåä Some UI elements.** Try interacting with the below elements.


```
icon = mo.ui.dropdown(["üçÉ", "üåä", "‚ú®"], value="üçÉ")
```


```
repetitions = mo.ui.slider(1, 16, label=f"number of {icon.value}: ")
```


```
icon, repetitions
```




```
mo.md("# " + icon.value * repetitions.value)
```


<span class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert"><h1 id="_1">üçÉ</h1></span>


## 3. marimo is just Python

marimo cells parse Python (and only Python), and marimo notebooks are
stored as pure Python files ‚Äî outputs are _not_ included. There's no
magical syntax.

The Python files generated by marimo are:

- easily versioned with git, yielding minimal diffs
- legible for both humans and machines
- formattable using your tool of choice,
- usable as Python  scripts, with UI  elements taking their default
values, and
- importable by other modules (more on that in the future).

## 4. Running notebooks as apps

marimo notebooks can double as apps. Click the app window icon in the
bottom-right to see this notebook in "app view."

Serve a notebook as an app with `marimo run` at the command-line.
Of course, you can use marimo just to level-up your
notebooking, without ever making apps.

## 5. The `marimo` command-line tool

**Creating and editing notebooks.** Use

```
marimo edit
```

in a terminal to start the marimo notebook server. From here
you can create a new notebook or edit existing ones.


**Running as apps.** Use

```
marimo run notebook.py
```

to start a webserver that serves your notebook as an app in read-only mode,
with code cells hidden.

**Convert a Jupyter notebook.** Convert a Jupyter notebook to a marimo
notebook using `marimo convert`:

```
marimo convert your_notebook.ipynb > your_app.py
```

**Tutorials.** marimo comes packaged with tutorials:

- `dataflow`: more on marimo's automatic execution
- `ui`: how to use UI elements
- `markdown`: how to write markdown, with interpolated values and
   LaTeX
- `plots`: how plotting works in marimo
- `sql`: how to use SQL
- `layout`: layout elements in marimo
- `fileformat`: how marimo's file format works
- `markdown-format`: for using `.md` files in marimo
- `for-jupyter-users`: if you are coming from Jupyter

Start a tutorial with `marimo tutorial`; for example,

```
marimo tutorial dataflow
```

In addition to tutorials, we have examples in our
[our GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/marimo-team/marimo/tree/main/examples).

## Finally, a fun fact

The name "marimo" is a reference to a type of algae that, under
the right conditions, clumps together to form a small sphere
called a "marimo moss ball". Made of just strands of algae, these
beloved assemblages are greater than the sum of their parts.
